    "\n",
    "2. **Isolate the Variable:** Your goal is to isolate the variable 'x' on one side of the equation. To do this, perform the following steps:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   a. **Add or Subtract Constants:** Add or subtract 'b' from both sides of the equation to move constants to one side.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   b. **Divide by the Coefficient:** Divide both sides by 'a' to isolate 'x'. If 'a' is zero, the equation may not have a unique solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simplify:** Simplify both sides of the equation as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Solve for 'x':** Once 'x' is isolated on one side, you have the solution. It will be in the form of 'x = value.'\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Check Your Solution:** Plug the found value of 'x' back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation. If it does, you've found the correct solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Express the Solution:** Write down the solution in a clear and concise form.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Consider Special Cases:** Be aware of special cases where there may be no solution or infinitely many solutions, especially if 'a' equals zero.\n",
